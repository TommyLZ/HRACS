# HRACS: Highly Reliable and Anonymous Cloud Synchronization

## Overview

**HRACS** is a password-based cloud storage (PBCS) scheme that enables secure dataset outsourcing and synchronization via password-based authentication. It simultaneously ensures **anonymity** (i.e., user activities cannot be linked to public identities) and **reliability** (i.e., users can detect any unauthorized modifications or rollback of their data).
